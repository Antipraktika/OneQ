                        One? is a custom designed card game for Tabletop Simulator by <a href="https://github.com/Antipraktika/">Antipraktika</a>. Each card has been
                        hand crafted to look elegant whilst still having a clear purpose. Designed in <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a>, the cards have a
                        soft color palette and have either text written using the <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Noto+Sans/">Noto Sans</a> font or an
                        icon.

                        One? has scripts written specifically to make the game easier to play for those that don't know the rules. The scripts are optional, however,
                        and can be disabled if you'd rather manually play the game or have your own custom rules in mind. If you have created a fun rule and want to
                        have it published, feel free to open an <a href="https://github.com/Antipraktika/OneQ/issues/">issue on GitHub</a> and it may be added to the
                        'House Rules' rulebook along with its own script to automate it (if possible).
